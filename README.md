# simple-api-call
1.	Fetch and display weather information based on the item’s location:
	•	The implementation allows users to input a city name and fetch weather information using the OpenWeather API. ✅
	2.	Fetch related articles from an external service:
	•	This part isn’t explicitly addressed, as it focuses solely on weather data. If you want to fetch related articles (e.g., news about the weather or city), an additional API (e.g., a news API) can be integrated similarly. ❌ (Partially Met)
	3.	Use JavaScript for the client-side API call:
	•	The fetch API is used in script.js to make client-side calls to OpenWeather API. ✅
	4.	Update the page dynamically based on the API response:
	•	The DOM is dynamically updated to display weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.) without reloading the page. ✅
	5.	Render a widget, table, or additional content:
	•	The implementation renders a weather “widget” dynamically. ✅
	6.	Ensure the API data updates without reloading the page:
	•	The page does not reload, and the content is updated dynamically by updating the DOM elements. ✅
